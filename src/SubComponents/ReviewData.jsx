        review: "These 6 projects of Adarsh are super user-friendly, I have used it and the interface is really great. Some of the apps are go to apps for our daily life. He has put a great effort and I would like to see more of his projects in future. He may also try to make some color effects or visual picture effects in the ShoGen app to make it more attractive. Good work!"
